 * Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the singleton class. 
 * When the singleton class is loaded, SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory 
 * and only when someone calls the getInstance method, 
 * this class gets loaded and creates the Singleton class instance.
 * This is the most widely used approach for Singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization. 
 * I am using this approach in many of my projects and it's easy to understand and implement also.
