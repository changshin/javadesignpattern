 * If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, 
 * this is the approach to use. But in most of the scenarios, 
 * Singleton classes are created for resources such as File System, Database connections etc 
 * and we should avoid the instantiation until unless client calls the getInstance method. 
 * Also this method doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling.
